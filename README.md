# pomodoro-GUI
WORK ONLY FOR LINUX, WILL MAKE A COMPILED VERSION FOR WINDOWS


This won't be a really a basic thing, i'd like to make some cool visual and appropriate modern effects, feel free to suggest. 

not sure what would work and what wouldn't, it depends on my work hours put in this personal project.


TODO; - a todo list to track it (will add more later)-


[important]: turn the program from SECs to MINs.
[important]: add parameter for the MIN.
[important]: add modern themes.
[effect]: add cast light linked to the mouse coordinates
